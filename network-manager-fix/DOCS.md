# Network Manager Fix Add-on for Home Assistant

This Home Assistant add-on was developed to address an issue observed in certain setups where **excessive network activity** is generated by Home Assistant's mDNS system. The problem often arises in networks with **Unifi mDNS reflectors** or other multi-VLAN setups, where mDNS packets are reflected across VLANs, causing **name collisions** and resulting in excessive mDNS traffic.

This addon sets the mDNS mode on the "Primary" interface (whether autodetected or explicitly configured, e.g. Supervisor enp1s0) to resolve.

This means that an mDNS name will not be advertised on this interface, and only mDNS resolution will be supported.

NB. For those running mDNS reflection across VLANs, and using this addon to avoid mDNS name clashes, this may not be the desired behaviour. In these circumstances, manually configuring the addon's "Primary" interface to point to a secondary interface (say, on an IOT VLAN), will restore mDNS advertisements on Home Assistant's primary interface, and suppress them on the secondary interface.

## Problem Overview

In affected setups, mDNS collisions trigger **frequent requests per second**, causing unnecessary network noise. Analysis revealed that modifying the mDNS mode could mitigate this behavior. However, manual changes to the mDNS mode via `nmcli` or other tools were **not persistent**, as the Home Assistant Supervisor often resets the mDNS configuration.

## mDNS Modes of Operation

This add-on leverages the `nmcli` tool to manage mDNS settings. The following modes are available for mDNS:

- **`yes`**: Enables both hostname registration and resolution.
- **`no`**: Disables mDNS completely.
- **`resolve`**: Enables only resolution, without registration.
- **`default`**: Uses the global default setting for mDNS, as determined by the active DNS plugin.

Many users, including myself, have found that setting the mDNS mode to **`resolve`** significantly reduces network activity while preserving essential functionality for integrations like ESPHome.

## Add-on Functionality

This add-on monitors the **mDNS mode** on a user-specified network interface. If it detects that the mDNS mode has been reset to `yes`, the add-on:

1. **Changes the mDNS mode back to `resolve`.**
2. **Restarts the NetworkManager service** to apply the change.

The monitoring happens at regular intervals to ensure consistency.

## Disclaimer

This add-on is provided as-is and was developed to solve a specific issue in my Home Assistant setup. It may not work for all configurations or network environments. Use at your own discretion.

- Always back up your Home Assistant configuration before installing or modifying add-ons.
- This add-on modifies network settings; ensure you understand the implications for your network setup.
- The add-on requires `nmcli` and assumes your Home Assistant instance uses **NetworkManager** for managing network connections.
